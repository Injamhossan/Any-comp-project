// Need to update local imports to avoid circular dependency issues if not handled carefully, 
// using "import type" or lazy evaluation in decorators helps.
// Since I am writing files sequentially, I will add relations to Specialist now that I am defining other files.

// RE-WRITING SPECIALIST TO INCLUDE RELATIONS (This is a simplified approach, usually I'd edit, but writing fresh is cleaner)
// Wait, I can't re-write the same file I just wrote in parallel steps easily without conflict or potential race key issues if I used parallel tool calls? 
// No, the tool calls are sequential in my thought process but I am dispatching them.
// I can just append relations to the Specialist class in a separate step or just rewrite it now correctly if I haven't dispatched yet. 
// I will just use `replace_file_content` later to add relations to User and Specialist.
